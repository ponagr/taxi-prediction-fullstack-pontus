# Labb AI Engineering 1 - taxi predictions

### Project explanation:
Taxi Prediction is a full-stack application that combines machine learning, backend, and frontend to predict taxi fares in real time. Through an API layer, the system is scalable, flexible, and easy to integrate with other services. The solution helps users make smarter decisions, plan their trips, and avoid unexpected costs. For Resekollen AB, the project represents a step toward becoming a complete platform for travel planning and future mobility.

#### Steps:
**1. model:**
- [ ] EDA, cleaning and normalizing data
- [ ] Evaluating different ML models and selecting the model with best performance
- [ ] Training and exporting the best ML model

**2. backend:**
- [ ] Creating API layer with endpoints to the ML model and data
- [ ] Validating input and output with pydantic

**3. frontend:**
- [ ] Connect streamlit dashboard to the API
- [ ] Take input and use the exported ML model to predict taxi prices
